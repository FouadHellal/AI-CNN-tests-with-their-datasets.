# Machine Learning, Deep learning and Q Learning Projects

Welcome to my machine learning repository! This collection includes various projects related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Data Regression, K-Mean Clustering, and Q Learning. Each script is designed to showcase different aspects of machine learning and data analysis.

## Project List

1. **CNN using Tensorflow with LTE_new-data.py**
2. **CNN using Tensorflow with image dataset.py**
3. **Data Regression with DataRegression.csv.py**
4. **Data Regression with House_prediction and Telco-customer-churn .py**
5. **KMean Clustering for DataTelecom.py**
6. **KMean Clustering for House_prediction.py**
7. **Kmean Clustering for LTE_full_data2.py**
8. **Shortest path with Q Learning.py**

Feel free to explore the projects, contribute, or provide feedback. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out!
